# Machine-Learning-with-Python--IBM-course-on-Couursera
A practical ML course which dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python.
This repository contains all the labs of the course which include different algorithms for regression, classification, clustering and even recommender systems. The libraries used for these are primarily scikit-learn and scipy.
I haven't included the quizzes because i feel they are easy and should be done by ourselves.
